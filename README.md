# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This guide is my first time creating a webpage (with the assistance of the Monash/EdX coding bootcamp) that includes HTML and CSS code. It has allowed me to show some beginner skills to other bootcamp students on listing information on a page, styling that information and it's surrounding layout, and running Javascript functions.

## Installation

n/a

## Usage

The page includes some basic facts about HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. Open DevTools to see a list of topics from the prework and you'll see a random suggestion on which topic to look at first.
